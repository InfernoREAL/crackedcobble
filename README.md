# CrackedCobble


CrackedCobble is a Minecraft server instance manager.  It is a web-based application that consists of a client
application and a server application (using node.js).  The server application runs on the Minecraft instance server and
serves the client application to user's web browsers and/or mobile devices.  The main user interface is a
mobile-friendly dashboard web application.  The dashboard provides a visual status indication of the Minecraft server
instances and provides simple start/stop control.
